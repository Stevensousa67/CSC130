Question 1) 

double mystery(int[] a){
	if(a.length == 0){
		return 0.0;
	}
	
	double x = 0.0;
	for(int i: a){
		x += i;
	}
	return x/a.length;
}

Answer: The purpose of the method is to return the mean of double x when divided by the length of array a.

Question 2)

double mean(int[] a){
	if(a.length == 0){
		return 0.0;
	}

	double x = 0.0;
	for(int i = 0; int i < a.length; i++){
		x += i;
	}
	return x/a.length;
}

Answer:	the logical error is that to get a mean, you need to add up all of the values in the received array (int[] a) and then divide by length of the same array.
